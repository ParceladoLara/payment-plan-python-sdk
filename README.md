# PAYMENT PLAN
This is the Lara Payment Plan, the heart of Lara Credit Proposal System.
It is a SDK that uses the same .so file as Lara will use to calculate the payment plan for the proposals, so that the user can easily simulate different payment plans in a efficient matter.

# ABOUT
This SDK as any other Lara Payment Plan SDK is a wrapper around the Lara Payment Plan Rust library, It relies on the dynamic library found inside the `internal` folder to perform the calculations.
As up to date, the library is only available for Linux and Windows, but it is planned to be available for MacOS in the future.

# CONTRIBUTING
This Repository is public but the Lara Payment Plan library is private, so the only way to build the library is to have access to the private repository.
With that said, the code here is generated from the private repository, and them made public, so any PR request can be looked but the changes will be made in the private repository and then generated here.
