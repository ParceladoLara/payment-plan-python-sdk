# PAYMENT PLAN
This is the Lara Payment Plan, the heart of Lara Credit Proposal System.
It is a SDK that uses the same .so file as Lara will use to calculate the payment plan for the proposals, so that the user can easily simulate different payment plans in a efficient matter.

# ABOUT
This SDK as any other Lara Payment Plan SDK is a wrapper around the Lara Payment Plan Rust library, It relies on the dynamic library found inside the `internal` folder to perform the calculations.
As up to date, the library is only available for Linux and Windows, but it is planned to be available for MacOS in the future.

# WORKING IN PROGRESS
This SDK is a work in progress, and it is not yet complete. The current version is only a prototype, and it is not yet ready for production use.
